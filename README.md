  <p1> A very simple bot, with mini-tests </p1>
</div>

---

## `description`
 - This bot was created to familiarize you with Telegram bots and the aiogram library. The bot was also written in just a few hours, so it may not be a very convenient code (do not judge strictly).

---

### `config` configuring the bot to run
- You need to change the BOT_TOKEN to your token in the `main.env` file

---

### `python` launching the bot via poetry
- Install Python (recommend [3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/))
- Install Poetry [Instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
- Go to the `poetry` section with the bot and write `poetry init`
- And now launch the bot using the command: `poetry run python -00 src` or `python __main__.py`
